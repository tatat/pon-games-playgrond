# Testing Strategy

Tests are concentrated where they pay off. UI polish and look-and-feel are left to manual review.

Related: [State Management](./state.md), [RNG](./rng.md).

| Area | Tested | Tool |
|---|---|---|
| Pure logic (`logic/` folder) | Heavily | Vitest |
| Stores | Heavily | Vitest |
| Collision, scoring formulas | Heavily | Vitest |
| Physics behavior (Rapier) | Selectively | Vitest |
| Entity rendering | Lightly | (rely on E2E) |
| Scenes & input flow | Critical paths only | Playwright |
| Animations, transitions | Not tested | Manual review |
| Visual regression | Critical screens only | Playwright screenshots |

## Decoupling logic for testability

Pure logic classes (no Pixi imports) belong in each game's `logic/` folder. Entity classes that extend `Container` keep a reference to a logic class and forward state changes to it. This split lets the bulk of game-rule unit tests run without spinning up Pixi.

## E2E Test Hooks

In test builds (`import.meta.env.MODE === 'test'`), each game installs a `window.__testHook` inside `start()` so the hook closes over that game's per-game store. The hook is replaced on every game switch.

```typescript
interface TestHook {
  /** Read current per-game store state. */
  getScore(): number;

  /** Drive the production game-over path:
   *  set the per-game store to game-over, call ctx.onGameOver(result),
   *  transition to the game-over scene. Equivalent to a real loss. */
  forceGameOver(): void;

  /** Stop / restart app.ticker for stable screenshots. */
  pauseTicker(): void;
  resumeTicker(): void;
}
```

The seed is set via the `?seed=N` URL query parameter rather than the hook (see [RNG § Seed source](./rng.md#seed-source)).

## Playwright canvas screenshots without flake

Canvas screenshots in Playwright are flaky for two reasons that have nothing to do with the game's correctness:

1. **Async fonts** — `Text` uses HTML/CSS-loaded fonts. Screenshots taken before fonts resolve render fallback glyphs.
2. **Ticker keeps running** — animations, physics, particle effects, BGM-driven shake. Two consecutive screenshots taken 16 ms apart can differ.

Standard preamble before `page.screenshot()`:

```typescript
await page.goto('/game/breakout?seed=42');
await page.waitForFunction(() => (window as any).__testHook?.getScore !== undefined);
await page.evaluate(() => (window as any).__testHook.forceGameOver());
await page.evaluate(() => document.fonts.ready);
await page.evaluate(() => (window as any).__testHook.pauseTicker());
await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot('breakout-game-over.png');
```

Two reinforcing notes:

- **Prefer `BitmapText` for HUD-heavy text.** Bitmap fonts are loaded via `preload`, so `await this.preload(...)` already guarantees readiness — `document.fonts.ready` only matters for regular `Text`.
- **Pause the ticker, not just the physics accumulator.** `app.ticker.stop()` halts `onUpdate` for every active scene, including HUD subscriptions and any tween/particle systems.

## Driving Pixi UI through the canvas

Canvas content is opaque to the a11y tree, so Playwright's element-locator clicks (`page.click(...)`, MCP `browser_click` with a snapshot ref) can't target Pixi widgets — settings tabs, segmented controls, in-game buttons. Two practical paths:

1. **Use `app.mouse.click(x, y)` / `page.mouse.click(x, y)`** with client-pixel coordinates. Simplest, but you still need the design→client mapping below.
2. **Dispatch synthetic `PointerEvent`s on the canvas** via `page.evaluate(...)`. Lower-level but works inside `browser_evaluate` from agents that don't expose raw mouse access.

The game canvas is letterboxed inside the viewport (uniform scale, equal side / top-bottom margins), so neither axis alone matches the viewport rect. Pull the same uniform scale `engine/layout.ts` uses:

```js
const r = canvas.getBoundingClientRect();
const scale = Math.min(r.width / 1280, r.height / 720);
const offsetX = (r.width - 1280 * scale) / 2;
const offsetY = (r.height - 720 * scale) / 2;
const toClient = (dx, dy) => ({
  x: r.left + offsetX + dx * scale,
  y: r.top + offsetY + dy * scale,
});
```

For the synthetic-event path, dispatch `pointerover` → `pointerdown` → `pointerup` on the canvas with `bubbles: true, cancelable: true, composed: true, pointerType: 'mouse', pointerId: <stable>, isPrimary: true`. Pixi v8 synthesises `pointertap` from a down/up pair on the same target, so this drives any `eventMode: 'static'` widget.

## Vitest with Rapier

Vitest runs tests in Node (optionally jsdom / happy-dom), not in a browser. `@dimforge/rapier2d-compat` bundles its WASM as inline base64, so no `fetch` / streaming setup is needed — but each test file that touches Rapier must initialize the module before use:

```typescript
import RAPIER from '@dimforge/rapier2d-compat';
beforeAll(async () => { await RAPIER.init(); });
```

Forgetting `RAPIER.init()` yields confusing errors like `RAPIER.World is not a constructor` because the WASM exports have not been bound yet.

Recommended Vitest config: keep physics tests on the `node` environment for stability — jsdom occasionally interacts badly with WASM init. A single test file can override with a `// @vitest-environment node` header comment.

The dev server side requires excluding the package from Vite's dependency prebundling so WASM init is not broken:

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  optimizeDeps: { exclude: ['@dimforge/rapier2d-compat'] },
});
```

## Coverage Targets

| Folder | Target |
|---|---|
| `logic/` | 80%+ |
| `store/` | 90%+ |
| `entities/` | ~30% (keep thin) |
| `scenes/` | not measured (covered by E2E) |
